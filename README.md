# CrowdPM Platform

Crowd-sourced PM2.5 air quality monitoring stack combining Firebase microservices with a WebGL Google Maps client.

## Highlights
- HMAC-validated ingest gateway stores raw payloads in Cloud Storage and pushes batch metadata to Google Cloud Pub/Sub for asynchronous processing.
- Pub/Sub-driven worker normalises and calibrates measurements before writing device hourly buckets in Firestore for fast queries.
- Fastify-based HTTPS API (`crowdpmApi`) exposes device, measurement, and admin endpoints consumed by the frontend and integration partners.
- React + Vite client renders Google Maps WebGL overlays via Three.js to visualise particulate data and provides a basic admin table for device management.
- pnpm-managed TypeScript monorepo keeps frontend and backend code in sync, with shared tooling for linting, builds, and testing.

## System Architecture
- **Ingest** (`functions/src/services/ingestGateway.ts`): Firebase HTTPS Function guarded by `verifyHmac`, persists raw JSON to `ingest/{deviceId}/{batchId}.json` in Cloud Storage and publishes `{deviceId, batchId, path}` to the `ingest.raw` Pub/Sub topic.
- **Processing** (`functions/src/services/ingestWorker.ts`): Firebase Pub/Sub Function downloads batches, applies calibration data from `devices/{deviceId}` (if present), and writes measurements to `devices/{deviceId}/measures/{hourBucket}/rows/{doc}` with deterministic sorting.
- **API** (`functions/src/index.ts`): Fastify server packaged as an HTTPS Function with CORS + rate limiting, mounting `/health`, `/v1/devices`, `/v1/measurements`, and `/v1/admin/devices/:id/suspend`. OpenAPI scaffold lives in `functions/src/openapi.yaml`.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): React 19.2 app built with Vite that toggles between a Google Maps 3D visualisation (`MapPage`) and an admin table (`AdminPage`). Uses the Maps JavaScript API and @googlemaps/three integration for overlay rendering.

## Repository Layout
- `frontend/` – Vite + React client, Google Maps visualisation, admin UI
- `functions/` – Firebase Functions (REST API, ingest gateway, Pub/Sub worker), shared auth/lib utilities, Vitest suites
- `docs/` – Developer guides (`development.md` and supporting installation notes)
- `infra/` – CI configuration and automation assets
- `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, `firebase.json` – Emulator and deployment rules + targets

## Prerequisites
Install these once per workstation:
- [Node.js 24.x](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm 10.x](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (`npm install -g firebase-tools`) with `firebase login`
- [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for Pub/Sub emulator tooling (optional but recommended)
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/), [Java 25 JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/), and [Git 2.34+](https://git-scm.com/)

Verify installations:
```bash
node -v
pnpm -v
firebase --version
gcloud -v
java --version
```

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repository and enter the workspace.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:denuoweb/CrowdPMPlatform.git
   cd CrowdPMPlatform
   ```
2. Install dependencies for all workspaces.
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Seed local configuration files (never commit the `.env.local` outputs).
   ```bash
   cp .firebaserc.example .firebaserc
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   cp functions/.env.example functions/.env.local
   ```
4. Supply real secrets:
   - `frontend/.env.local`: Google Maps API key + vector map ID, API base URL (emulator or deployed).
   - `functions/.env.local`: shared INGEST HMAC secret and optional custom Pub/Sub topic.

### Environment Variables

`frontend/.env.local`

| Name | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE` | Base URL for the Firebase HTTPS API. | `http://127.0.0.1:5001/demo-crowdpm/us-central1/crowdpmApi` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Maps JavaScript API key with WebGL overlay access. | `AIza...` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAP_ID` | Vector map style ID for WebGL overlay (required). | `test-map-id` |

`functions/.env.local`

| Name | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INGEST_HMAC_SECRET` | Shared secret used by `verifyHmac` to authenticate ingest requests. | `replace-with-hmac-secret` |
| `INGEST_TOPIC` | Pub/Sub topic name for ingest batches (defaults to `ingest.raw`). | `ingest.raw` |

## Running Locally
Launch the entire stack from the repo root:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
- `crowdpm-frontend`: Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173`
- `crowdpm-functions emulate`: Firebase Emulator Suite (Functions, Firestore, Storage, Auth, Pub/Sub, Emulator UI at `http://localhost:4000`)
- `crowdpm-functions build:watch`: TypeScript compiler emitting to `functions/lib/`

Keep this terminal open; rebuilds stream into the emulator automatically.

## Testing & Quality Gates
- Unit tests: `pnpm --filter crowdpm-functions test`
- Linting: `pnpm lint` (workspace-wide ESLint on TS/TSX sources)
- Type + build checks: `pnpm -r build`
- CI mirrors the build command; run locally before pushing to keep `infra/github-ci.yml` green.

## API Surface
The REST contract is documented in `functions/src/openapi.yaml` and implemented in `functions/src/index.ts`:
- `GET /health` – environment probe
- `GET /v1/devices` – list devices (auth optional in emulator)
- `POST /v1/devices` – create device (requires Firebase ID token)
- `GET /v1/measurements` – query PM2.5 readings by device, time window, and limit
- `POST /v1/admin/devices/:id/suspend` – mark device as suspended (requires authenticated user)

Set a Firebase ID token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to satisfy `requireUser`.

## Data Model & Storage
- Firestore: `devices/{deviceId}` documents store device metadata and optional `calibration` fields; measurements live under `measures/{hourBucket}/rows/{doc}` with UTC bucket IDs computed via `hourBucket`.
- Firestore: `devices/{deviceId}/batches/{batchId}` records ingest batch metadata (`count`, `processedAt`).
- Cloud Storage: raw ingest payloads saved to `ingest/{deviceId}/{batchId}.json` for auditing and replay.
- Pub/Sub: default `ingest.raw` topic triggers `ingestWorker` for eventual consistency processing.

## Security Considerations
- Ingest clients must HMAC-sign payloads with `INGEST_HMAC_SECRET`; unsigned or mismatched signatures are rejected (`verifyHmac`).
- Firebase Auth tokens gate device creation and admin routes via `requireUser`.
- Firestore and Storage rules ship locked-down defaults: device and measurement data are read-only to external clients, ingest blobs are entirely private.

## Deployment
Use the Firebase CLI once credentials and target project are configured:
```bash
firebase deploy
```
Ensure `.firebaserc` points to the intended project (avoid using the `demo-` alias outside emulator workflows). Configure runtime secrets (e.g., `INGEST_HMAC_SECRET`) through Firebase environment configuration or Cloud Secret Manager before deploying.
